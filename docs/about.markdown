# Why'd we build it?
With insect populations shifting and declining in the face of climate change, monitoring insects in nature to understand and protect them has become a critical task in conservation. Most approaches to monitoring insects at large scales are expensive and labor intensive. We wanted to create a cheap automated system to obtain relative abundance data for insects, using the potential of citizen science to scale up moth monitoring across the United States. BioLens makes it simple for you to start monitoring!  We also know that an application you can configure to take photos over a certain period and at a set of configurable time steps may be useful for other lab or field monitoring applications, and BioLens has already proved useful outside of just insect monitoring.

# What does it do?
BioLens is an open source smartphone-based application that simplifies automated monitoring and metadata collection.  With this phone app and some very simple materials, you can let BioLens do the monitoring for you. All you need is some insect-attracting UV lights and a sheet, and AutoMoth will automatically take pictures of visiting insects. You can then download the images and metadata to your computer using the Android File Transfer app, or upload them to a Google Drive folder or shared data repository. You can also upload insects the system has spotted to other applications, such as iNaturalist, to help get them identified by experts.

# How to make and use? 
A full insect monitoring system using BioLens can be made without any tools using many materials you might already have around the house. Depending on what you already have, a full monitoring system can be made for between $35 to $125. 
Necessary supplies include:
- Used Android smartphone with a 20 MP or better camera (\~$60)
- Mount to hold the smartphone (\~$20)
- Weatherproof phone case (\~$10)
- UV lights (\~$20)
- Light-sensing power strip to turn on the lights at night (\~$15)
- Plastic board and sheet for the insects to land on (\~$10)
To use, just place the system in your backyard or natural area, plug it into power (or attach an additional solar battery system), specify times to turn on and how many images you want to capture, then leave it be. When you return, hundreds of insect images will be saved to the smartphone at the ready for upload and use.
